## Data-class
# What is this?

- This is a simple Java program that works with dates. It can:

- Check if a date is valid (leap years too!).

- Change the date.

- Find out what day of the week a date is.

- Count the number of days between two dates.

- Show the date in a nice format (like "January 1, 2023").

- Sort dates in order (oldest to newest).

# Extra Stuff

It knows leap years

It uses a cool formula (Zeller's Congruence) to figure out the day of the week.

Dates are sorted by year first, then month, then day.

If you try to enter a wrong date, it will show an error.

# Additional Notes or Challenges

Leap years are tricky. The program correctly handles them, but it can be confusing.

Sorting dates sounds easy, but You have to compare years, then months, then days.
